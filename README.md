IreCore is a World of Warcraft simulator for the purpose of boosting large-scale theorycrafting, for fury warriors. IreCore is aimed at making the speedup as high as possible. 

IreCore is derived from the [LuaCL project](https://github.com/llxibo/LuaCL) as an initial practice. IreCore Kernel is being developed in OpenCL C for heterogeneous computing.

This project is under very first phase.
