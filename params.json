{"name":"IreCore","tagline":"A High Performance Simulator for Fury Warriors.","body":"### Why IreCore?\r\nIreCore is a high performance, event-oriented, heterogeneous simulator written in OpenCL C, models a warrior character with fury spec dealing damage to a single raid boss.\r\n\r\nCurrently the state-of-the-art simulator [SimulationCraft](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc) is far more functional than IreCore. But while large-scale theorycrafting (e.g. [APLGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/aplga) & [Maxima Climb](https://github.com/AeanSR/climb)), the effeciency of SimC cannot meet our needs. For example, APLGA runs **billions** of sim iterations to generate APL from scratch, for SimC that means approximately 1000 hours CPU time, 41 days without a break. That seems unacceptable.\r\n\r\n![SpeedUp SimC versus IreCore](http://sim.aean.net/speedup_comp.png)\r\n\r\nWith IreCore, the simulation speedup for common configurations skyrocketed 20x relatively, and even faster for simplified configurations. What's more, IreCore is able to run on CPU, or GPU, or whatever compute devices support OpenCL, such as Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. If you run two IreCore process simutaneously on both CPU and GPU, you would get even 2x more faster.\r\n\r\nAPLGA needs approximately 50 hours CPU time with IreCore as its evaluation function. If we run on both CPU and GPU, it needs just 1 day to get result. Sounds pretty good.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
