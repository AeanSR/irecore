{"name":"IreCore","tagline":"A High Performance Simulator for Fury Warriors.","body":"### Why IreCore?\r\nIreCore is a high performance, event-oriented, heterogeneous simulator written in OpenCL C, models a warrior character with fury spec dealing damage to a single raid boss.\r\n\r\nCurrently the state-of-the-art simulator [SimulationCraft](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc) is far more functional than IreCore. But while large-scale theorycrafting (e.g. [APLGA](https://github.com/AeanSR/aplga) & [Maxima Climb](https://github.com/AeanSR/climb)), the effeciency of SimC cannot meet our needs. For example, APLGA runs **billions** of sim iterations to generate APL from scratch, for SimC that means approximately 1000 hours CPU time, 41 days without a break. That seems unacceptable.\r\n\r\n![SpeedUp SimC versus IreCore](http://sim.aean.net/speedup_comp.png)\r\n\r\nWith IreCore, the simulation speedup for common configurations skyrocketed 20x relatively, and even faster for simplified configurations. What's more, IreCore is able to run on CPU, or GPU, or whatever compute devices support OpenCL, such as Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. If you run two IreCore process simutaneously on both CPU and GPU, you would get even 2x more faster.\r\n\r\nAPLGA needs approximately 50 hours CPU time with IreCore as its evaluation function. If we run on both CPU and GPU, it needs just 1 day to get result. Sounds pretty good.\r\n\r\n### IreCore Philosophy\r\nDamage dealing process in World of Warcraft is a _Fully Observable Markov Process_. That means an APL without internal states (Hereinafter referred to as _sAPL_) can be one of the optimal policy.\r\nsAPL is a mapping from the state set _**S**_ to the action set _**A**_. So if we are at the same state _s_ at different time _t1_ and _t2_, we get the same action _a_ from a sAPL.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
